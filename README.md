## Welcome to this repository
I'm planning to upload here some design pattern implementation for (mainly my own) educational purpose.
Right now everything is a mess (i didn't even test anything yet), but whenever i can i'll put some order and make a main file for each language to test and try the classes.

As you can guess looking the repository, the codes are for both Java and Python. I'm writing those in parallel, so those may be influenced by each other.
Comments are lacking, i'll try to remember to put some.

So, here's a list of planned Design Pattern, based on what can be found [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern):

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Maffolandro/Desing-Pattern/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Maffolandro/Desing-Pattern/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
